# AAVAiL Churn Analysis 📊  
### Investigating Customer Churn in the USA vs. Singapore  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project explores **customer churn trends** in AAVAiL's streaming service, focusing on **differences between the USA and Singapore**. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, we identify key insights to understand **why Singapore has a higher churn rate** and propose **data-driven strategies** to reduce churn.

---

## 📌 Key Steps in the Analysis  
✔ **Handled missing data** (imputed missing values & removed unnecessary columns).  
✔ **Performed EDA** to analyze subscription trends and user engagement.  
✔ **Compared churn rates** between **Singapore & USA**.  
✔ **Investigated factors like streaming behavior & age** to explain churn.  
✔ **Visualized key insights** using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**.  
✔ **Provided actionable recommendations** to improve customer retention.

## 📊 Key Findings  
📌 **Churn rates are significantly higher in Singapore than in the US.**  
📌 **Streaming activity is similar across both regions, meaning content preferences might drive churn.**  
📌 **Age does not seem to strongly influence churn behavior.**  
📌 **Targeted retention strategies and content localization could help reduce churn in Singapore.**

## 🔍 Visualizations  
We created various **plots and charts** to support our findings, including:  
✅ **Pie charts** for missing values & churn breakdowns  
✅ **Histograms** for user engagement  
✅ **Box plots** for subscription trends  
✅ **Churn rate comparisons** between countries
